By grouping the data by race and then identifying the top five offenses for each racial group, we created a summary table that highlights the relative frequency of various offenses.\n\nKey insights from this analysis included:\n\nEven though Felony Assault and Petit Larceny appear frequently across all races, the ranking and counts differ.\n\nSome racial groups show a different offense mix, suggesting that while the overall trend of high counts in common offenses is evident, there are underlying variations that merit further exploration.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(janitor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncleaned_data <- read_rds(\"dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds\")\nrace_offense_table <- cleaned_data %>%\n  count(perp_race, ofns_desc, sort = TRUE) %>%\n  group_by(perp_race) %>%\n  slice_max(n, n = 5) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  arrange(perp_race, desc(n))\nggplot(race_offense_table, aes(x = reorder(ofns_desc, n), y = n, fill = perp_race)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ perp_race, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 5 Offense Types by Race\",\n    x = \"Offense Type\",\n    y = \"Number of Arrests\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nEDA Output 2: Top Offenses by Gender\n\nNext, we compared offense frequencies by gender. A bar chart of the top three offenses for males and females revealed that both genders share similar offense categories. However, males are arrested in significantly higher numbers across these categories.\n\nKey insights here are:\n\nThe types of offenses remain consistent between genders, but the volume of arrests varies greatly.\n\nThis observation raises further questions about whether demographic distribution or other confounding factors are influencing the observed differences.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncleaned_data <- read_rds(\"dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds\")\ncleaned_data %>%\n  count(perp_sex, ofns_desc, sort = TRUE) %>%\n  group_by(perp_sex) %>%\n  slice_max(n, n = 3) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(ofns_desc, n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  facet_wrap(~ perp_sex, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 3 Offense Categories according to Gender\",\n    x = \"Offense Category\",\n    y = \"Number of Arrests\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nModeling Approach:\n\nResponse Variable: Arrest Borough\n\nPredictor Variables: Offense Description, Race, and Age Group\n\nData Transformations: We consolidated infrequent offense types through factor lumping and transformed categorical variables into dummy variables to make them compatible with the model.\n\nModel Type: Since our response variable is categorical, we used multinomial logistic regression.\n\nOur next steps include:\n\nExperimenting with more advanced models (like random forests or gradient boosting) to capture non-linear interactions.\n\nTesting interaction terms (such as race by offense or age by race) in our logistic regression.\n\nIncorporating additional variables, like temporal data, to assess how these patterns evolve over time.\n\nPotentially normalizing by borough population to better understand enforcement intensity.\n\nBy moving from descriptive analysis to predictive modeling, we’re beginning to answer not only “what is happening?” but also “why is it happening?” This progression is essential as it deepens our insights and opens up new avenues for both academic inquiry and policy discussion.\n\n",

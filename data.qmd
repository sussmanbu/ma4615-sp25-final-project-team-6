# Data Sources and Description

Our project merges **NYPD Arrest Data** with **American Community Survey (ACS)** unemployment data. This section outlines the sources, variables of interest, and how we cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.

---

## Original Data Sources

We used two main publicly available datasets for our project:

### NYPD Arrest Data  
**Link**: [NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) — data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date)  
**Description**:  
This dataset includes arrest records from the New York Police Department, updated quarterly. It contains details on arrest location, offense description, age group, race, sex of the person arrested, and more.  
**Publisher**: NYC Open Data / NYPD  
**Last Updated**: January 2025

---

###  American Community Survey (ACS)  
**Link**: [ACS 5-Year Estimates — census.gov](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)  
**Description**:  
We extracted borough-level unemployment statistics from ACS table **S2301 (Employment Status)**. These rates were joined with arrest data to study the relationship between local economic conditions and arrests.  
**Publisher**: United States Census Bureau  
**Data Year**: 2023

###️ NYC Borough Shapefile  
**Link**: [NYC Borough Boundaries — NYC Planning](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/zip/data-maps/open-data/nybb_23a.zip)  
**Description**:  
Used for spatial joins and mapping borough-level arrest locations.  
**Publisher**: NYC Department of City Planning  
**Format**: Shapefile (SHP)

## Data Cleaning Process

We cleaned and merged multiple datasets into one standardized format, with the cleaned result saved as  
`combined_nypd_acs_with_coords_fixed.rds`.

### Major cleaning steps

- **Selected relevant variables**:  
  `perp_race`, `perp_sex`, `age_group`, `ofns_desc`, `arrest_boro`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `unemployment_rate`.

- **Removed missing values** in key fields such as `perp_race`, `perp_sex`, `age_group`, and coordinates.

- **Standardized factor levels**: Re-coded values for `age_group`, `perp_race`, and `arrest_boro` to ensure consistent formatting and interpretation.

- **Cleaned string variables**: Trimmed whitespace, fixed inconsistent capitalization (e.g., `ofns_desc` and `pd_desc`), and applied `str_to_title` where appropriate.

- **Joined multiple datasets**:  
  - Merged 2024 NYPD Arrest data with 2023 ACS unemployment data (`S2301`, `S1701`, `S1901`) by borough.
  - Used shapefiles (`nybb.shp`) to ensure accurate geographic mapping and merge borough-level unemployment statistics to spatial layers.

- **Added spatial coordinates** using `sf::st_as_sf()` to create an `sf` object for mapping purposes, based on the `longitude` and `latitude` values from the arrest records.

- **Removed unnecessary columns** like arrest key, jurisdiction code, and other administrative identifiers not useful for analysis.

- **Exported the cleaned dataset** using `write_rds()` to `dataset/combined_nypd_acs_with_coords_fixed.rds` for efficient loading in analysis pages.

This process allowed us to produce a well-structured dataset suitable for modeling, visualization, and spatial analysis across NYC boroughs. The cleaned file integrates both demographic and economic data, enabling analysis of nonviolent arrests across geographic and racial dimensions.

## Arrest Counts by Race

```{r fig-arrest-by-race, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
cleaned_data <- read_rds("dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds")
cleaned_data %>%
  count(perp_race, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(perp_race, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#4472C4") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Arrests by Race",
    x = "Race",
    y = "Number of Arrests"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


This bar chart summarizes the total number of arrests by race across all NYPD records in the dataset.

- **Black individuals** represent the highest number of arrests by a wide margin, surpassing 120,000 cases.
- **White Hispanic** and **Black Hispanic** groups follow, with noticeable but lower totals.
- **White** and **Asian / Pacific Islander** individuals are arrested at significantly lower rates.
- The **Unknown** and **American Indian/Alaskan Native** categories appear rarely, possibly due to underreporting or classification limitations.

This visual reinforces racial disparities observed in NYC arrest data and provides strong motivation for deeper statistical analysis of structural bias.

## Map 1: Arrests Overlaid on Unemployment Rates

```{r map-arrest-unemp, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

combined_data <- read_rds("dataset/combined_nypd_acs_with_coords_fixed.rds")
nyc_map <- st_read("dataset/nybb.shp", quiet = TRUE)

combined_data <- combined_data %>%
  mutate(unemployment_rate = as.numeric(unemployment_rate))

borough_unemp <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(borough) %>%
  summarise(unemployment_rate = mean(unemployment_rate, na.rm = TRUE))

nyc_map <- nyc_map %>%
  mutate(borough = case_when(
    BoroName == "Manhattan" ~ "MANHATTAN",
    BoroName == "Brooklyn" ~ "BROOKLYN",
    BoroName == "Queens" ~ "QUEENS",
    BoroName == "Bronx" ~ "BRONX",
    BoroName == "Staten Island" ~ "STATEN ISLAND"
  )) %>%
  left_join(borough_unemp %>% select(borough, unemployment_rate), by = "borough") %>%
  select(-matches("^unemployment_rate\\\\..*"))


arrest_points <- combined_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(longitude), !is.na(latitude)) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE)

set.seed(42)
plot_data <- arrest_points %>% sample_n(3000)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nyc_map, aes(fill = unemployment_rate), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightyellow", high = "darkred", na.value = "grey80") +
  geom_sf(data = plot_data, aes(color = perp_race), size = 1, alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "NYC Arrest Locations Overlaid on Borough Unemployment Rates (2024)",
    subtitle = "Boroughs shaded by unemployment rate. Points show arrests colored by race.",
    fill = "Unemployment Rate (%)",
    color = "Race"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This map visualizes the spatial distribution of 3,000 sampled arrests in New York City, overlaid on borough-level unemployment rates from the American Community Survey (2024).

- **Borough fill color** represents the average unemployment rate, ranging from pale yellow (lower unemployment) to dark red (higher unemployment).
- **Colored dots** indicate the location of individual arrests, with each color representing a different racial group.

From this map, we observe:

- **The Bronx**, which has the **highest unemployment rate**, shows a dense cluster of arrests, particularly among **Black** and **Hispanic** individuals.
- **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn** show mixed patterns, but also include neighborhoods with both high unemployment and high arrest density.
- **Staten Island** and **Queens** have relatively lower unemployment and fewer arrests overall.

This geospatial visualization helps us connect economic conditions with policing outcomes, suggesting that economic hardship and race may jointly influence where and who gets arrested.

## Map 2: Simplified Arrest Location View

```{r map-simple-arrest, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nyc_map, fill = "gray95", color = "black") +
  geom_sf(data = plot_data, aes(color = perp_race), size = 1, alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Arrest Locations in NYC (2024)",
    subtitle = "Each point represents an arrest. Colored by race.",
    color = "Race"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This simplified map provides a **clean spatial overview** of arrest locations across New York City in 2024. Each point represents a single arrest, with colors denoting the race of the arrested individual.

- The **underlying borough boundaries** are shown in light gray with black outlines to keep the focus on arrest points.
- Dense clusters of points are clearly visible in **Brooklyn**, **the Bronx**, and **Upper Manhattan**, indicating higher concentrations of police activity.
- Racial disparities are visually apparent, with **Black (green)** and **White Hispanic (purple)** individuals making up a significant portion of arrests across multiple boroughs.
- **Staten Island** and **eastern Queens** show relatively fewer arrest locations, consistent with lower population density and arrest rates in those areas.

This visual is useful for gaining an intuitive sense of **geographic distribution** and **racial composition** in NYC arrest patterns, independent of economic overlays.

## Final Data Files

After cleaning and merging, we generated a single standardized `.rds` file that combines arrest data, demographic variables, unemployment statistics, and geolocation for mapping. This file is the basis for all subsequent analysis and visualization.

### `combined_nypd_acs_with_coords_fixed.rds`

| Variable Name        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `perp_race`          | Race of the person arrested (e.g., BLACK, WHITE HISPANIC, UNKNOWN)          |
| `perp_sex`           | Gender of the person arrested (M / F)                                       |
| `age_group`          | Age category (e.g., 18-24, 25-44)                                            |
| `ofns_desc`          | NYPD offense description (e.g., LARCENY, TRESPASS)                          |
| `arrest_boro`        | Borough where the arrest took place (e.g., MANHATTAN, BRONX)                |
| `unemployment_rate`  | Borough-level unemployment rate (from ACS S2301)                            |
| `longitude`, `latitude` | Geographic coordinates of the arrest, used for mapping                  |

**File Location**: `dataset/combined_nypd_acs_with_coords_fixed.rds`  

This file serves as the foundation for modeling, mapping, and statistical inference throughout the analysis. It allows spatial, demographic, and economic patterns to be studied jointly.

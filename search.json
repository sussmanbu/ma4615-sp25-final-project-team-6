Notably, the effect of unemployment is not uniform across race groups. Some odds ratios approach or cross the threshold of 1, suggesting potential non-significant or neutral effects, as also reflected in the p-values.\nThis visualization enables a clearer interpretation of complex regression output and supports nuanced discussion of demographic disparities."

    "section": "Interpretation and Limitations",
    "text": "Interpretation and Limitations\nThe interaction term between race and unemployment rate in our logistic regression model is statistically significant, indicating that the relationship between unemployment and the likelihood of being arrested for a nonviolent offense differs across racial groups. Specifically, in boroughs with higher unemployment, Black and Black Hispanic individuals show disproportionately higher predicted probabilities of being arrested for nonviolent crimes. This suggests that socioeconomic context may compound with racial disparities to amplify arrest risks for certain populations. The interaction visualization confirms these patterns, with steeper slopes observed for marginalized racial groups.\nLimitations:\n\nArrests are not convictions: Our dataset includes arrest records, not court outcomes. Therefore, some individuals in the data may never have been found guilty of any offense. Policing practices—potentially influenced by racial bias or over-surveillance—may distort patterns of who gets arrested in the first place.\n\nBorough-level aggregation: We use borough-level unemployment rates, which may obscure neighborhood-level or block-level variation. More granular geographic data would allow for a finer-grained understanding of local economic conditions.\n\nNonviolent offense classification: Our binary outcome relies on regex-based keyword matching in offense descriptions. This introduces the possibility of misclassification, as not all nonviolent offenses may be labeled clearly or consistently in the dataset."

The interaction between race and unemployment underscores how structural inequalities—economic disadvantage layered atop racial disparities—can intensify the likelihood of arrest for certain groups. These patterns align with broader concerns about equity and justice in urban policing.\nFrom a policy perspective, this analysis emphasizes the need for targeted reforms that address both the economic vulnerabilities and racial injustices embedded in the criminal justice system. Future work should incorporate more localized data and expand outcome variables beyond arrests to include prosecutions and sentencing. Nevertheless, our results provide strong evidence of persistent systemic disparities and offer direction for data-driven intervention strategies."

We’ve successfully conducted an indepth analysis and produced several charts/graphs highlighting demographic differences in violent crime victimization in Chicago. Our visuals include clear breakdowns by sex and race, and support a story about inequalities in crime victimization. We’ve also formulated a preliminary narrative thesis highlighting the significant disparities based on sex and race to form the foundation of the Big Picture article.\nThe first task we still need to complete is the interactive dashboard component. We have a template and dataset ready, but we still need to finalize our Shiny dashboard to make sure it supports our narrative by allowing users to explore different demographics interactively. Also, we’re editing our Big Picture article’s to create an engaging, clear, and informative style similar to popular media. Next steps include finalizing a creative and engaging headline, finishing the explanatory text around each visualization, and making sure the interactive components flow with the narrative.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(sf)\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.13.0, GDAL 3.8.5, PROJ 9.5.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\ncombined_data &lt;- readRDS(\"dataset/combined_nypd_acs_with_coords_fixed.rds\")\nnyc_map &lt;- st_read(\"dataset/nybb.shp\")\n\nReading layer `nybb' from data source \n  `/Users/martin/Downloads/BU/SPRING 2025/MA 415/Team 6/dataset/nybb.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 5 features and 4 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 913175.1 ymin: 120128.4 xmax: 1067383 ymax: 272844.3\nProjected CRS: NAD83 / New York Long Island (ftUS)\n\n\nArrest Count by Borough\n\ncombined_data %&gt;%\n  count(arrest_boro) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(arrest_boro, -n), y = n, fill = arrest_boro)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Total Arrests by Borough in 2024\", x = \"Borough\", y = \"Number of Arrests\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrests vs. Unemployment Rate\n\ncombined_data %&gt;%\n  count(arrest_boro) %&gt;%\n  left_join(distinct(combined_data, arrest_boro, unemployment_rate), by = \"arrest_boro\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = unemployment_rate, y = n, label = arrest_boro)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, color = \"steelblue\") +\n  geom_text(vjust = -1) +\n  labs(title = \"Arrests vs Unemployment Rate by Borough\",\n       x = \"Unemployment Rate (%)\", y = \"Number of Arrests\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrests by Race and Sex\n\ncombined_data %&gt;%\n  count(arrest_boro, perp_race) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = arrest_boro, y = n, fill = perp_race)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Arrests by Borough and Race\", x = \"Borough\", y = \"Number of Arrests\", fill = \"Race\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncombined_data %&gt;%\n  count(arrest_boro, perp_sex) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = arrest_boro, y = n, fill = perp_sex)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Arrests by Borough and Sex\", x = \"Borough\", y = \"Number of Arrests\", fill = \"Sex\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Offense Types in High vs Low Unemployment Areas\n\ncombined_data %&gt;%\n  distinct(arrest_boro, unemployment_rate) %&gt;%\n  mutate(unemployment_level = ifelse(unemployment_rate &gt;= median(unemployment_rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                     \"High Unemployment\", \"Low Unemployment\")) -&gt; boro_unemp_group\n\ncombined_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(boro_unemp_group, by = \"arrest_boro\") %&gt;%\n  count(unemployment_level, ofns_desc) %&gt;%\n  group_by(unemployment_level) %&gt;%\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(prop, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(ofns_desc, prop), y = prop, fill = unemployment_level)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top Offense Types in High vs Low Unemployment Boroughs\",\n       x = \"Offense Description\", y = \"Proportion\", fill = \"Unemployment Level\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrest Map - Colored by Race\n\narrest_points &lt;- combined_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude), !is.na(latitude)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE)\n\nset.seed(42)\nplot_data &lt;- arrest_points %&gt;% sample_n(3000)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = nyc_map, fill = \"gray95\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf(data = plot_data, aes(color = perp_race), size = 1, alpha = 0.6) +\n  labs(title = \"Arrest Locations in NYC (2024)\",\n       subtitle = \"Each point represents an arrest.

These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets.

    "text": "Datasets we will be combining are: Primary Dataset - NYPD Arrest Data (2024). Our cleaned dataset includes variables such as perp_race, perp_sex, age_group, ofns_desc (offense description), and arrest_boro (borough where the arrest occurred) throughout the year 2024. Secondary Dataset - American Community Survey (ACS) 2023 1-Year Estimates – We will be honing in on the boroughs that are included in our primary dataset - Bronx, Staten Island, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. Specifically, we will be using the following metrics for each of the 5 boroughs - Unemployment Rate (Table: S2301) - Median Household Income (Table: S1901) - Poverty Rate (Table: S1701)\nHow the datasets will be combined: Both datasets contain borough identifiers, so we will combine the datasets using the arrest_boro field from our cleaned NYPD Arrest data and matching borough names in the ACS data (Bronx, Staten Island, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens).\nWe chose to combine the arrest data with economic indicators from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-Year Estimates for a few reasons: - The NYPD dataset provides information on who is being arrested and where, but it doesn’t explain why certain boroughs might have more arrests and crimes. Hence, including borough-level data on unemployment, poverty, and income for the respective boroughs adds broader context that can be used to answer our overarching research question. - Arrest or crime patterns are greatly influenced by structural conditions in an area, such as economic inequality and unemployment. Including economic data will enable us to examine whether boroughs with higher poverty, higher unemployment and lower household income experience higher arrest rates. - Furthermore, the 2023 ACS 1-Year Estimates are the most recent reliable economic data that is available and align with the 2024 NYPD arrest data.\nInitial findings: From our cleaned NYPD dataset, we found that Brooklyn had the highest number of arrests (72,325 arrests in 2024), followed by Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens. Staten Island had the fewest number of arrests. This pattern aligns with economic indicators from the ACS 2023 dataset Brooklyn has relatively high unemployment (6.7%) and moderate poverty (18.3%), suggesting that these economic conditions could be contributing to higher arrests. With the lowest poverty and unemployment rates, Staten Island has by far the lowest arrest count (11,055). Hence, the conclusion is that boroughs with lower income, higher unemployment, and higher poverty tend to have more arrests in general.\nPotential difficulties in combining the datasets: The NYPD arrest data is based on the year 2024, whereas the most recent economic data available from the ACS is 2023. Hence, some comparisons may not reflect the exact state of the economic conditions during the time of arrest. Secondly, some of the offense descriptions in the NYPD arrest data are vague, which can make it difficult to categorize offenses as economically motivated or not."

    "text": "Our dataset focused on New York Police Department arrest Data and was separated according to what kind of crime was committed, along with the location where it occurred. Members of the Office of Management Analysis review sets of data over time and update the database. NYC Open Data acquires more cases from agencies that are responsible for managing such cases. NYPD serves as one of the oldest police departments and is notorious for dealing with heinous crimes, some of them being setting a man on fire. The data we found was referenced from the data.gov website. The data that we viewed was from the original source, as it is the data set that police agencies from NYC Open Data view and update.\nThe dataset looks unorganized, with the age groups of the felonies being in random order and race category in random order, along with the dates not being in chronological order. The sample population would be the first 10,000 columns, as any further columns have empty datasets. The dataset isn’t necessarily biased, as it is a mere record of criminal activity not in a specific order or specialization. This data is used by journalists, researchers and even advocacy groups who all analyze practices of crime and arrests within New York City. There has been other research on it from numerous policy research and academic papers that use the data to study racial disparities in several areas. This data is not specifically used for policy decisions, however it can be involved in discussions regarding racial profiling and police reform, enabling a change in the criminal justice system in New York City. Some common questions that others asked about this data are as follows:\n1.Are certain racial or ethnic groups disproportionately arrested?\n2.How do arrest patterns vary by borough or precinct?\n3.How has NYPD enforcement shifted over time?\n4.What types of crimes result in the most arrests?"

We standardized column names and cleaned string variables by trimming whitespace and applying consistent formatting (e.g., title-casing offense descriptions).

While both genders share similar top offenses such as, assault-related charges and petit larceny, males are arrested at a higher frequency for each of the 3 offense categories. This visualization allows for an easier comparison of actual counts, pointing to the disparities in number of offenses respective to gender.\n\ncleaned_data %&gt;%\n  count(perp_race, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  perp_race                           n\n  &lt;fct&gt;                           &lt;int&gt;\n1 BLACK                          122049\n2 WHITE HISPANIC                  69131\n3 BLACK HISPANIC                  26549\n4 WHITE                           26161\n5 ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER        14838\n6 UNKNOWN                           956\n7 AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE    819\n\n\nThis table looks at the distribution of arrests by race categories. We found that a disproportionate number of arrests (122049) were recorded for individuals who are ‘Black’, which is way higher than other races. In comparison, categories including American Indian/Alaskan Native and Unknown had fewer than 1,000 arrests each. These patterns could be showing real-world differences, but also allows us to raise further questions when analyzing our dataset."

This is especially visible in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, where offenses like misdemeanor assault, vehicle violations, and miscellaneous offenses show clear racial disparities.\nThese patterns are not reflective of crime severity, but rather of enforcement practices. The fact that the same types of offenses are consistently associated with higher arrest proportions for Black and Hispanic populations suggests a systemic pattern of targeted policing. This reinforces the broader concern that communities of color are more heavily surveilled — and more harshly penalized — for low-level offenses."

This age group consistently dominates the arrest proportions across all five offense types. The 18–24 and 45–64 brackets also show notable presence, while individuals under 18 and over 65 make up only a small share.\nThis pattern may reflect broader socioeconomic dynamics: younger adults are often more exposed to environments where petty crimes or drug-related activities are policed more aggressively. The data suggest that policing practices disproportionately affect people in early adulthood, raising concerns about the long-term impacts of criminal records on employment, housing, and community integration.\nThese findings underscore the importance of age-sensitive approaches to justice. Rather than relying on punitive systems, community-driven and rehabilitative responses may offer more effective and equitable outcomes — especially for non-violent offenses committed by younger individuals."

In the chart above, we observe a positive relationship between the average unemployment rate and the number of nonviolent arrests in each borough. Boroughs like the Bronx and Brooklyn, which face higher unemployment rates, also report a disproportionately large number of arrests for nonviolent offenses—such as drug possession, petty theft, and trespassing.\nThis trend suggests that economic hardship may contribute to increased vulnerability to low-level policing. While unemployment does not directly cause crime, it can reflect broader systemic issues—such as underinvestment in certain communities, limited access to education, and fewer economic opportunities—that may lead to a heavier police presence and enforcement in economically disadvantaged areas.\n\n\nInteractive Dashboard\nYou can explore the interactive arrest dashboard here:\n👉 Launch Interactive Dashboard\nOr view it embedded below:\n\n\nThis interactive dashboard allows users to explore arrest patterns across New York City’s boroughs, filtered by offense type and demographic characteristics. By selecting filters for race, sex, or age group, users can examine how specific populations are represented in arrest data — and how those patterns vary across geography.\nFor example, selecting “Race” as the demographic filter reveals disparities in arrest volumes for offenses like petit larceny or drug possession, particularly in boroughs like the Bronx and Brooklyn. Users can further investigate whether certain offenses are more concentrated in specific neighborhoods, or how demographic groups experience differential exposure to law enforcement.\nThis tool complements the broader analysis by giving the public direct access to the data — empowering them to identify patterns of potential over-policing or demographic bias in arrests. Interactive exploration also reinforces the importance of transparency and public accountability in understanding how justice is distributed in our cities."
